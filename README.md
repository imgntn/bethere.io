==========
this is a project that i built during graduate school as a reference implementation of an all-javascript virtual environment, built with the cloud in mind.  i built it because i had a number of art collectors tell me, in reference to a previous piece i had done, that they didn't buy digital art because it doesn't last.  "floppy disks, you know"?  

so i imagined what it would be like to have a piece that never gets old -- packaging the OS, browser, server, and app together without any specific hardware means that as long as we can simulate less powerful computers inside of more powerful ones, the piece will run.  basically, i built it to run in an emulator.

still working on this, occasionally.  will probably do a wholesale refactor in the next year.  this was one of my first javascript projects so the code is not pretty.
